I am 24 years old, born in 2000, and just like the the century then, my life has turned some times already. I was born in Rio, but soon moved to Aracaju, where my brother was born, while my father was finishing his military studies in Salvador. I have moved 22 times in my life so far, living in all regions of Brazil except for the North, and for one year in Germany. Adapting constantly wasn't easy but for sure made me who I am. It gave me perspective, the kind I would never have if I had a "normal" life I guess. Never satisfied, and a bit naive, even young I wanted to fly higher than I could and I this innocence of not knowing what is impossible brought me to challenge the reality I had in front of me. Started learning programming at age 13, my first language was Pascal, influence of my father. At about the same age I got my first guitar from grandpa, and this is one of my main hobbies to this day. I also love cooking, something I certainly got from both my grandmas. During High School I took part in many extracurricular activities, staying at the basics never did it for me. In college I also founded (and sometimes co-founded) most of the extracurricular activities we now have, shaped our Computer Science Week to be the host of huge guest such as Amazon and Google. Again, never settled for less then I thought was possible. Currently I am almost finished with this degree in Computer Science and already working full-time as an Application Engineer in an Israeli startup. I look however, for a place where I can flourish this drive for going farther, flying higher and I see in TOTVS the place to do that and once again contribute more. Contributing, after studying and working, is the third wheel of my life (maybe it is a tricycle). Wherever I go I feel the need to improve it, and cannot ignore the feeling.
