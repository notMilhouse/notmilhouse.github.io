Hello there!

I am Gabriel, a computer science student at the Univeristy of SÃ£o Paulo and I was chosen for an exchange program at TU Braunschweig in Germany! [link do edital]

This page used to be a fundraising campaign for me to come to Germany and be able to pay for plane tickets and the first month expenses. Now, it's again a fundraising page so that I can stay one more semester and with time, I hope to make it a place where I can share the events and all I've been learning with this experience.

For the first semester, I got an scholarship from my university, but it could not be renewed. The decision to stay, however, came from the opportunity of being able to work in university jobs and therefore to look for internships at companies nearby.

After a semester here, in which I devloped several projects and had the opportunity to study new things with amazing professors, it made sense to throw myself head first in the search for work opportunities, in order to attempt extracting the most out of the chance of being abroad.

With work and payment, I should be able to finance myself here, however, the scholarship money is now over and the challenge of supporting myself until the first salary emerged.

That's why I come once again to ask for your help, by sharing or donating!

Details follow with the calculated expenses and expected bills, as well as the current status of the fundraising and the information for national and international deposit.
