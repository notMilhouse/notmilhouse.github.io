            <h1>Hello there, I am Gabriel.</h1>
        
            <p>Currently I am an intern at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iea.usp.br/iea/onde-estamos/ribeirao-preto">IEA - USP</a>. There, we impact education throughout the country, and to make that possible, we have a team responsible for data analysis and engineering. As part of that team I have been working on improving databases architecture as well as implementing integration and devops systems.</p>
            
            <p>Before that I had been for 2 years a software engineering intern at <a href="https://institucional.ifood.com.br/?utm_source=site_ifood" target="_blank">iFood</a>, from which experience I am now able to contribute a lot in my current internship.</p>
            
            <p>Also, I am a computer science student at the <a href="https://www5.usp.br/" target="_blank">University of SÃ£o Paulo</a> and prior exchange student at <a href="https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/" target="_blank">TU Braunschweig</a>.</p>

            <p>As hobbies I love to cook and play the guitar. I am also a metalhead that enjoys samba and brazilian popular music.</p>

            <p>If you want to say hi, please send me a message at <a href="gabriel_carvalho@usp.br">gabriel_carvalho@usp.br</a>.</p>

            <p><i style="font-style: italic;">vita motu constat</i> - I believe we weren't ever meant to last, but to constantly become anew, everywhere and all the time. Therefore, being essential, intentional and mindful are key to who I am and want to become. Putting myself up to the challenge of perhaps leaving a mark of (hopefully positive) impact in people lives is what drives me.</p>
