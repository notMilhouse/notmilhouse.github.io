                <h1>Outreach, Projects and Contribution</h1>
                
                <p>Here are some of the projects I have worked on or that I am currently contributing to, feel free to reach out if you feel you can help also, and feel free to copy any of it! Eventually I will add some pictures to make it a scrap book of good memories</p>

                <h3>Computer Science Academic League</h3>
                <p>Founded in early 2025, this is my dream project. As soon as we have the website ready I will link it here. The goal of this group is to become a study hub not only for students in the bachelor program at my alma matter but also for anyone that wants to break through the limitations of what's taught in class or is available on the internet. For fun, or for any reason really.</p>
                <h3>Octobit (Junior Company of the Computer Science BSc program at USP-RP)</h3>
                <p>The only group in my university I didn't found or co-found, and one of the nicest things the program has now. I took part of it as the Head of Projects at the time I was part of it and now I am in as the counselor for the group, sometimes providing some workshops on software development.</p>
                <h3>GEMPRO (Coding Competition Study group at USP-RP)</h3>
                <p>The first thing I founded in the bachelor program (actually co-founded with my friend Maria Vit√≥ria). This group has grown a lot since then, being headed now by much better contest coders than I ever was.</p>
                <h3>Hypatia</h3>
                <p>Once a week for 1h I give algebra lessons in a community prep course for the university entrance exam. In Brazil the gap in learning mathematics is huge and it is something that should be further addressed by politicians. Meanwhile, we try to help it out ourselves.</p>
                <h3>Tutorship</h3>
                <p>
                    I have worked as a mentor in most of the courses given in the bachelor program. It really helps learning or relearning things so you don't forget them, but also it helps a lot new students with less background in either mathematics or informatics. I actually see in tutorship not a solution only for students with academic debts, but also as one of the most efficient social politics for student retention.
