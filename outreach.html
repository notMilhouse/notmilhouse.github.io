                <h1>Outreach, Projects and Contribution</h1>
                <p>
                Mixing research (academy), technical work (work) and contribution (outreach and community work) makes a lot of sense to me, I believe being holistic brings more purpose to life. I am not talking hobbies, those should be done because you feel like (I think), not something planned out (otherwise it has become a project then).
                </p>
                
                <p>There are a couple reasons I think you should consider putting time and effort into extra things (that are not "just" hobbies). Some of those reasons are more "career" thought of and others are more aligned with "moral values" so to speak.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The "useful" reasons, for those more interested in getting return out of things:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Career-wise, if you want to become the one hunt for hiring and not the one hunting for jobs, becoming more proactive, literally being a protagonist (not in the coach bullshit sense of it, but actually taking initiative on whatever you want to do), by building a platform you not only show where you wanna go. But, you also filter down where your energy goes so you can focus on where you wanna go and what you wanna build.</li>
                        <li>It helps build portfolio and shows you can speak to people (soft skills are the hardest to find, anyone can read a book on coding).</li>
                        <li>You expand your knowledge areas by putting yourself up to the challenge of dealing with new things without waiting for your job or whatever to face them.</li>
                        <li>Helps you develop a brand.</li>
                    </ol>

                    The "heart" reasons, for those searching for purpose (guess which one motivates me the most :) ):
                    <ol>
                        <li>Individual, local, efforts come faster than government initiative to wherever you are. The farther from big urban areas the more true this is (based on data from my head). Meaning that by contributing to wherever you are, however you can, you are actually helping people there to have a better life. Doesn't matter if through education or through solving community issues with tech, it's not that hard to make an impact on people's lives just by giving a bit of your time and knowledge. This might sound a bit anarchist (because it is), but the point here is to bring to ourselves the responsibility for the change we want to see out there (cliche as fuck I know, but I mean it).</li>
                        <li>I was lucky as fuck in life, friends and colleagues were not so much. Pretending luck is not a thing and trying to defend the so called "meritocracy" is either machiavellian or innocent (usually the first). Being aware of that makes it so that I could not feel that I don't a responsibility to give back and try to help other people have some luck also.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                
                <p>And here are some of the projects I have worked on or that I am currently contributing to, feel free to reach out if you feel you can help also, and feel free to copy any of it! Eventually I will add some pictures to make it a scrap book of good memories</p>

                <h3>Computer Science Academic League</h3>
                <p>Founded in early 2025, this is my dream project. As soon as we have the website ready I will link it here. The goal of this group is to become a study hub not only for students in the bachelor program at my alma matter but also for anyone that wants to break through the limitations of what's taught in class or is available on the internet. For fun, or for any reason really.</p>
                <h3>Octobit (Junior Company of the Computer Science BSc program at USP-RP)</h3>
                <p>The only group in my university I didn't found or co-found, and one of the nicest things the program has now. I took part of it as the Head of Projects at the time I was part of it and now I am in as the counselor for the group, sometimes providing some workshops on software development.</p>
                <h3>GEMPRO (Coding Competition Study group at USP-RP)</h3>
                <p>The first thing I founded in the bachelor program (actually co-founded with my friend Maria Vit√≥ria). This group has grown a lot since then, being headed now by much better contest coders than I ever was.</p>
                <h3>Hypatia</h3>
                <p>Once a week for 1h I give algebra lessons in a community prep course for the university entrance exam. In Brazil the gap in learning mathematics is huge and it is something that should be further addressed by politicians. Meanwhile, we try to help it out ourselves.</p>
                <h3>Tutorship</h3>
                <p>
                    I have worked as a mentor in most of the courses given in the bachelor program. It really helps learning or relearning things so you don't forget them, but also it helps a lot new students with less background in either mathematics or informatics. I actually see in tutorship not a solution only for students with academic debts, but also as one of the most efficient social politics for student retention.
