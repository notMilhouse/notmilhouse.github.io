                <h1>Pilot</h1>
                <p>
                    I am 24 as I write this presentation text and so far I have moved 20 times in my life, between cities, houses, and most importantly across Brazil and around the world. So... life has been <b>literally</b> about moving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually I learned about this quote, that has since resonated in me, which is "<i>vita motu constat</i>" (or "life is in constant movement"). Being aware of this ever-changing aspect of life since young, becoming intentional soon became a need. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe we weren't ever meant to last, but to constantly become anew, everywhere we go and everyday. Despite <i>cliche</i>, being intentional/mindful is essential to follow this perception. It makes me quite happy to know what's enough. Might seem boring, but I think it's grounding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless, as much as reality allows, I try to keep the "essentialism" vibe when it comes to deciding what I put my energy on and (more importantly) what I don't. Creating this blog is something I wanted to put my energy for a long time now, but never did, so I decided to stop wasting time and energy on some other useless things in my life and look a bit inside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that's all this blog is all about. Of course there will be technical stuff here for the nerd that I am, but I have been writing for myself on diaries since ever, drafting ideas and coming up with meditations on so many things, so why not share a bit? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't mean even for a second to be presumptions by assuming people want to know about what I think, but I believe that it will be good for my own sake to store those things somewhere that doesn't get lost in a drawer like a notebook or lost in the fading of ink. Besides that, I have been told I helped people more than once by bringing new perspectives, so maybe there might some use to the gibberish that crosses my brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For some reason writing in english is easier for me, perhaps because it gets less personal, but I will for sure write both in portuguese and english here and I will try to post always both versions.
