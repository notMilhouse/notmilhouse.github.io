        <div class="content">
            <p>I am a computer science bachelor at the <a href="https://www5.usp.br/" target="_blank">University of São Paulo</a> and prior exchange student at <a href="https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/" target="_blank">TU Braunschweig</a>, currently working at Foretellix as an Associate Application Engineer, and trying to develop an academic career on Systems Architecture and Development.</p> 
            <p>Mixing research (academy), technical work (work) and contribution (outreach and community work) makes a lot of sense to me.</p>
            <p>As hobbies I love to cook and play the guitar. I am also a metalhead that enjoys samba and brazilian popular music. Not to forget that I have been fighting judo and bjj for some years now.</p>
            <p>If you want to know more about my career or academic life (not only about studies) you might want to check out the blog section of this website.</p>
            <p>I would suggest these posts to start: <a href="../pages_blog/posts/pilot.html">pilot</a>, <a href="../pages_blog/howwegothere.html">you might be wondering how we got here</a>, and <a href="../pages_blog/careerstatus_octo2024.html">current career status - october 2024</a>.</p>
