                <h1>About me - Formally</h1>
                <p>I am a computer science bachelor student at the <a href="https://www5.usp.br/" target="_blank">University of SÃ£o Paulo</a> and prior exchange student at <a href="https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/" target="_blank">TU Braunschweig</a> (why is it important to mention? well, because it was super fun!!), currently working at Foretellix as an Associate Application Engineer, and trying to develop an academic career on Systems Architecture and Development.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Mixing research (academy), technical work (work) and contribution (outreach and community work) makes a lot of sense to me, holistic could be my middle name and I deeply see the benefits of nurturing all three of these for a career with some purpose.</p>
                <p>As hobbies I love to cook and play the guitar, not to forget that I have been fighting Judo and BJJ for some years now, so don't come trying to hit me or you might get in trouble.</p>
                <p>If you want to know more about my career or academic life (not only about studies) you might want to check out the blog section of this website.</p>
                <p>I would suggest to start with the <a href="blog_pilot.html">pilot</a>.</p>

                <h1>About me - For real tho</h1>
                <p>Behind glasses and screens I am an average height guy with some passion for the little details in life, even though sometimes life itself gets in the way of being able (time and energy wise) to contemplate those.</p>
                <p>I was born in Rio, but moved almost everywhere in Brasil so I am not a real "carioca" (I don't know if that's bad or good honestly). However, even though it was always chaotic and hard to be always adapting, I think I as lucky to live like this and get some perspective soon enough. Fear of failing is something very new to me, but I would say I am lucky because the long-lasting naivity allowed me to aim high and get even higher than I expected to go in the first place.</p>
