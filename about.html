                <p>I am a BSc in Computer Science by the <a href="https://www5.usp.br/" target="_blank">University of São Paulo</a> and prior exchange student at <a href="https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/" target="_blank">TU Braunschweig</a> (why is it important to mention??! well, because it was super fun!!), currently working at Foretellix as an Application Engineer.</p>

                <h1>About me - For real tho</h1>
                <p>Behind glasses and screens I am an average height guy with some passion for the little details in life, even though sometimes life itself gets in the way of being able (time and energy wise) to contemplate them.</p>
                <p>I was born in Rio, but moved almost everywhere in Brasil so I am not a real "carioca". However, even though it was always chaotic and hard to be always adapting, I think I was lucky to live like this and get some perspective sooner than later. Fear of failing is something very new to me, but I would say I am lucky because the long-lasting naivity allowed me to aim high and get even higher than I expected to get to in the first place.</p>
                <p>I have graduated after 6 years in university, which for some might seem like a waste of time (for taking so long). I see it differently, tho. I didn't spend 6 years doing nothing. On the contrary, I took an exchange year and before that I was first in my class, also founded and co-founded many projects and groups in my campus, as well as helped many other initiatives to grow. Bottomline, I feel like I have used 6 years to experience and do a lot more than people usually do and I am confident those things contributed to an early boost in my career and maturity.</p>
