                <i>vita motu constat</i> (or "life is in constant movement") - This quote has impacted me for sometime now.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am 24 as I write this presentation text and so far I have moved 20 times in my life, between cities, houses, and most importantly across Brazil and the around the world. So... life has been <b>literally</b> about moving.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe we weren't ever meant to last, but to constantly become anew, everywhere we go and everyday. Despite <i>cliche</i>, being essential, intentional and mindful are key to who I am and want to become as I put myself up to the challenge of perhaps leaving a mark of (hopefully positive) impact in people lives is what inspires me in all I do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, as much as reality allows (regarding the system we live in as well as what must be done to keep one's existence), I try to keep the "essentialism" vibe when it comes to deciding what I put my energy on and (more importantly) what I don't. Creating this blog is something I wanted to put my energy for a long time now, but never did, so I decided to stop wasting time and energy on some other useless things in my life and look a bit inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                And that's all this blog is all about, looking inside me. Of course there will be technical stuff here for the nerd that I am, but I have been writing for myself on diaries since ever, drafting ideas and coming up with meditations on so many things, so why not share a bit? 
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't mean even for a second to be presumptions by assuming people want to know about what I think, but I believe that it will be good for my own sake to store those things somewhere that doesn't get lost in a drawer like a notebook or lost in the fading of ink. Besides that, I have heard I helped people at least once with conversations and perspectives, so maybe if I am lucky enough, there might some use to the gibberish that crosses my brain.
            </p>
            <p>
                For some reason writing in english is easier for me, perhaps because it gets less personal, or more romantic hahaha but I will for sure write both in portuguese and english here and I will try to post always both versions.
