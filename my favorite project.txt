Yet old, my favorite project was made 10 years ago (give or take). A brief context: I was something like 12 years old, with divorced parents and living with my mom, and I didn't have a PC at home yet, father a systems analyst in the Brazilian Army. One day, coming back from vacation at dad's, I asked him to borrow a book in his shelf: Programming Techniques with Pascal. As mentioned, I didn't have a PC back then so I would write down the code in paper following the book and then whenever possible call my father, my personal linter and compiler, to know if that was indeed right. Eventually I got a very simple laptop from grandma and started writing Pascal on DevPascal, it was my obsession. I then developed a full featured school transcript management CLI program. Implemented a cutting edge (irony) text file based database (I had no idea what that was) and showed to my informatics teacher. He told me it was really good and replied "of course you should" when I suggested I wanted to sell that to the school. Little I knew how simple the program actually was and I am happy my teacher lied to me. It inspired to learn more and soon my Christmas whishlist became full of programming books. It was just a simple CLI, but it was the beginning of everything, on paper. In my head it was amazing and I will never forget the feeling of accomplishment that came with it.
